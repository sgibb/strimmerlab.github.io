Dear Evoldir members,

I am one of the coauthors of the treefinder (2004) paper.  

I would like to strongly distance myself from the extremist, racist, and otherwise crude world view that is propagated on the treefinder webpage.

I have not been in contact with Gangolf Jobb for over a decade, since he left my group in September 2004 (then at the University of Munich).

Best regards and my sincere apologies,

  Korbinian Strimmer
