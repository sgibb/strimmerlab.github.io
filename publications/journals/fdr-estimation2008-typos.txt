Page 3:

- Equation 3:  F(p) = ...
  [capital F] 


- Subsequent equation:  Fdr(p_i) = ...
  [capital F] 


Page 8:

- the formula in the last sentence "The truncated null density.."
  contains F_0 [not F]


Page 9, first paragraph:

- "corresponding likelihood function returns \hat{theta}"
  [\hat{theta} instead of \hat{eta}_0]

- \hat{eta}_0 = min{1, m_t/m F_0(...) }
  [min instead of max and F_0 instead of F]


Page 9, fourth paragraph:

- "interpolation at \gamma_c=0"
  [0 instead of 1]
