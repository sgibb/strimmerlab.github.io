		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.12.0


From this version "GeneTS" is a meta-package only, with 
no own functions.  It exists for reasons of backward compatibility. 


CHANGES

    o the functions related to inference of gene networks
      have been moved into the package "GeneNet"
    
    o the functions connected with periodicity testing are
      now in the package "GeneCycle"
      
    o the functions for fdr controlling an testing are now
      in the package "fdrtool"



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.10.2

CHANGES

    o dependencies have been increased: now corpcor (>= 1.4.2)
      and longitudinal (>= 1.1.2) are required.  This enables
      one to use the protected shrinkage estimators.  The fraction
      of protected components can be specified via the parameter
      "protect" in ggm.estimate.pcor().
   
    o the functions sm2vec(), vec2sm(), and sm.index() have been
      moved to corpcor package.
    
    o in the documentation all web links to the Strimmer group
      page now point to strimmerlab.org.
      
      

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.10.1


CHANGES
    
    o because of code changes (LAPACK.svd -> svd)
      ggm.simulate.data() didn't work anymore - now fixed.
      
    o example script for estimation of a relevance network added.
    
    

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.10.0


This is the offical Bioconductor version 1.8 release (27 April 2006).

CHANGES
    
    o some small internal changes were made in order to make GeneTS 
      work with the graph/Rgraphviz packages from BioC 1.8.
    
    o new functions sm2vec(), sm.indexes() and vec2sm() 
      (these used to be part of "corpcor").
    

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.9.0

In this versions some of the functions were cleaned up, obsolete
methods were removed, the plotting method and the computational
procedures were improved.


CHANGES
    
    o robust.spectrum() now  gives a warning if a constant time series 
      is being analyzed.  It now also works with a single time series.
      
    o documentation was updated (new addresses etc.)
    
    o dependency on "corpcor" revised to version 1.2.0.  This versions
      offers much faster computation of partical correlations.
    
    o the infrastructure for longitudinal data and the tcell data 
      set was moved into the separate package "longitudinal".  GeneTS
      now depends on this package.


REMOVED

    o the option "fA.type" was removed in cor.fit.mixture() and 
      ggm.test.edges(). The previous default "nonparametric" is now standard.
    
    o in ggm.estimate.pcor() the options for the estimators 
      "observed.pcor", "partial.bagged.cor", and "bagged.pcor" have been 
      removed.
      
    o the function cor0.estimate.kappa() was removed.
      
         
NEW FUNCTIONALITY

    o ggm.list.edges() is a new utility function.
    
    o ggm.estimate.pcor() now offers a possibility to compute dynamic 
      correlation. 

    o there is a new example script illustrating the network inference
      for the tcell data.

    o the plotting functions have been simplified and greatly improved:
      In ggm.make.graph() now node.lables can be specified, and unconnected
      nodes are removed if desired.  show.edge.weights() now displays 
      the clear names of the nodes, not just node indices. The plots
      output by ggm.plot.graph() visualize the strength of the association
      by color and by line width.  Negative correlation is indicated by
      dotted lines. Different layout types can be selected.




		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.8.0


No change, expect for version number (due to new scheme on the Bioconductor side).



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.7

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o new functions robust.g.test(), g.statistic(), and robust.spectrum()
      implementing the periodicity testing approach by Ahdesmaki et al.
      (BMC Bioinformatics 2005). 

    o new data set "ecoli" for illustration of network inference
    

CHANGES

    o GeneTS now relies on the external package "corpcor" for 
      computation of partial correlations. 
      
      Note that "corpcor" is a spin-off  of GeneTS to bundle generic 
      functions like shrinkage estimation of large-scale covariance
      matrices and correlations.
        
    o ggm.simulate.data() now throws an error if the input (pcor) matrix 
      is not positive definite
    o cor.fit.mixture() and ggm.test.edges() now have a plot.locfdr" 
      option to control the plots produced by locfdr
    o The example scripts were updated (to use the E. Coli data for
      network inference, and to employ local fdr for the g-test) 
    o The functions is.square() and is.symmetric() were removed and
      sime of the documentation was cleaned up.



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.6
		

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o cov.shrink() and and cor.shrink() allow shrinkage estimation
      of the covariance and correlation matrices.  This is especially
      useful in high dimensions (small n, large p setting).
    
    o corresponding utility function varcov(): estimates variance of the
      individual components of the empirical covariance matrix 
    
    
CHANGES		

    o ggm.estimate.pcor() now uses as default the shrinkage estimators.

    o inclusion of pdf/ppt info slide in documentation section

    o check of model fit added to density.pr()

    o example script adopted to shrinkage function
    
    o some descriptions corrected
    
    o in cor.fit.mixture() and ggm.test.edges() now has a df parameter
      (controlling the density fit)

    o is.positive.definite() now checks if input is a matrix
      (this also fixes the "is.positive.definite(-1)=TRUE" bug
      pointed out by David Stoffer)
		

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.5

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o density.pr() enables semi-parametric density estimation
      using a Poisson regression fit to histogram counts.

    o new data structure "longitudinal" allows to store multiple time series
      data with repeated measurements, irregular sampling, and unequally
      spaced  time points.  Related basic input/output functions include
      as.longitudinal(), is.longitudinal(), summary.longitudinal(),
      print.longitudinal(), plot.longitudinal().
      
    o a number of utility function for the "longitudinal" data type 
      were added: get.time.repeats(), is.equally.spaced(), is
      is.regularily.sampled(), has.repeated.measurements(), 
      combine.longitudinal(), condense.longitudinal(). 
    
    o the caulobacter data set was converted to type "longitudinal",
      and another data sets (T cell activation) was added.  



CHANGES		

    o a bug was fixed in fisher.g.test(): for time series longer
      than 341 time points a numerical problem occured due to
      the divergence of the gamma function.  This has now been
      fixed by using a more clever algorithm to compute the
      g-statistic (bug fix kindly suggested by  Benjamin Tyner)
      
    o GeneTS now requires R 2.0.0 or later, and locfdr version 1.0-2
    
    

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.4

	
NEW FUNCTIONS

    o when fitting the empirical null distribution f0 for the
      correlation coefficients with cor.fit.mixture() the alternative
      hypothesis fA can now also be estimated *non-parametrically*.
      Previously, it was assumed that fA is a uniform distribution.
      
      For this estimation "GeneTS" relies on the external "locfdr"
      package (available on CRAN). 


CHANGES		
    
    o many parts of the documentation have been rewritten to
      clarify details and correct some minor errors. The notation
      has also been changed to conform to statistical standards
      (e.g., p is used instead of G, n instead of N, etc.).
      References were also updated.
    
    o a bug was fixed in make.positive.definite(): pmax() instead
      of max() is now used (bug fix kindly pointed out by Leslie Cope).
      
    o in the function avgp() the title is now taken from the name
      of the data object, rather than simply using "untitled".
      (This was suggested by Benno Putz).
      
    o the function cor.prob.nonzero() is removed - this functionality
      is now available in cor.fit.mixture().
      



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.3
		
This release introduces substantial (factor 2-20!) speed improvements
in the computation of the parameters of graphical Gaussian models.


CHANGES		

    o installation requirements have been rolled back to R 1.9.0
      and Bioconductor 1.4 (instead of R 2.0 and BioC 1.5).

    o standardize.cov() has been removed, in favor of the native
      and faster cor2pcor() function.
      
    o for (numerically) singular matrices rank.condition() now returns
      condition number "INF". 

    o the function partial.cor(x) is now *much* faster due to a new algorithm,
      especially for small n, large p.


NEW FUNCTIONS

    o fast.svd() computes the singular decomposition *much* faster
      for "fat" or "thin" matrices.
    
    
     

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.2
		
CHANGES		

    o in rank.condition(), is.positive.definite() and pseudoinverse()
      the cut-off criterion for non-zero singular values (d) has
      been changed in order to be in agreement with the definition used
      in MATLAB, Octave etc. Now, the condition is
         
	 dpos > max(dim(m))*max(d)*.Machine$double.eps
      
      replacing the previously used 
     
         dpos > max(d)*sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)

      Note that the latter criterion is used, e.g., in ginv() in MASS.

    o is.positive.definite() now has an option to employ the Cholesky
      decompostion for testing positve definiteness.
   
    o the manual pages have been updated (e.g., reference to Schaefer and
      Strimmer 2004)
    
    o GeneTS now requires R version 2.0 and only works with the "Rgraphviz"
      and "graph" packages from Bioconductor version 1.5.  Legacy code that
      made GeneTS work with older versions of BioC was removed.   

NEW FUNCTIONS
 	
    o make.positive.definite() takes a real symmetric matrix and 
      computes the nearest positive definite matrix, using the algorithm
      of Higham (1998).



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.1.2

CHANGES

    o edge colors associated with positive and negative correlation
      can now be specified in ggm.plot.graph().
      
    o plotting of edge labels can now be turned off on request.

    o internal detection of the version of the installed graph and Rgraphviz
      libraries is improved.



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.1.1

CHANGES

    o in ggm.plot.graph() a small change is introduced to make it work
      with Rgraphviz version 1.3.25 (layoutType is explicitly specfied
      when getDefaultAttrs() is called).


		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.1
		
		
This release contains changes to make GeneTS work with the 1.4 release of
Bioconductor (in particular with the updated Rgraphviz package in BioC 1.4).
Note that GeneTS 2.1 should work both with BioC 1.3 and BioC 1.4. 
This release also corrects several small optimization problems present
in GeneTS 2.0.1.  

CHANGES
    
    o dcor0() now works correctly also for large values of kappa.
      In previous versions dcor0() returned NaN for kappa > 170.
      Similarly, pcor0() can now also be used for large values of kappa.
      In addition, dcor0() and pcor0() now always return the correct values
      (instead of NaNs) at the boundaries r=-1 and 1, and for r=0.
	 
    o in cor.fit.mixture() the upper bound MAXKAPPA for the estimated
      kappa can now be specified as optional argument. In addition,
      a warning message is issued if the estimated kappa equals MAXKAPPA.
      The default for MAXKAPPA is 5000. The minimum value of kappa is now 1
      (used to be 2). Furthermore,  the estimated degree of freedom kappa is
      not rounded to an integer value any more.
      
    o cor0.estimate.kappa() now also has a MAXKAPPA option and also doesn't
      round estimates of kappa any more.
       
    o ggm.test.edges() now also has a MAXKAPPA option.  The eta0 estimated
      in this function is now explicitely used in determining the q-values
      (previously, the conservative choice eta0=1 was assumed). 

    o the "ts" and "modreg" packages needed by GeneTS are now loaded only
      when running R versions <= 1.8.1.  From R version 1.9 these packages
      are merged into the default "stats" package.
    
    o  ggm.plot.graph(), ggm.make.graph() and show.edge.weights() now check
       whether the "graph" and the "Rgraphviz" packages are available, and
       if not return an error message.
      
    o  if BioC 1.4 is used ggm.plot.graph() plots edges with negative correlation
       in grey color (postive partial correlation is plotted in black color).  


NEW FUNCTIONS

    o pcor() is renamed to partial.cor() to avoid name collision with a
      function of the same name in the package "ggm".
  
    o show.edge.weights() summarizes a graph objects by printing the vector
      of edge weights 
      
    

		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.0.1
		
		
This is a bug-fix release that corrects several small problems present in
GeneTS 2.0.  It also contains changes to make GeneTS more compatible with
the upcoming version 1.9 release of R.

CHANGES

    o help pages for ggm.estimate.pcor, ggm.simulate.pcor, ggm.simulate
      data were changed (5% replaced with 5 percent), the unused argument
      "p" from documenentation in dcor0 was removed, and a reference in
      fdr.control was corrected
    
    o the example session for inferring GGMs was slightly changed (to fix a
      bug and to make it easier to run a similar analysis for own data)

    o in bag.fun results containing NAs are now flagged as erroneous so that
      the corresponding bootstrap draws are repeated in robust.boot

    o a confusing warning message in robust.boot was removed
    
    o the robust bootstrap is now halted when there are more than R errors
    
    o the functions fisher.g.test, is.constant, dominant.freqs,
      periodogram.spec, and periodogram.freq now also take data frames
      (and not just matrices and vectors)
   
    
		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 2.0


NEW FEATURES

    With version 2.0 GeneTS provides functions to infer large sparse graphical
    Gaussian models, following an approach outlined in:

    Schaefer, J., and K. Strimmer. 2003. A practical approach to inferring large
    graphical models from sparse microarray data. Submitted to Bioinformatics.
    [Preprint available from http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~strimmer/]

NEW FUNCTIONS
 
    o ggm.simulate.pcor, ggm.estimate.pcor, ggm.simulate.data, ggm.test.edges
    
    o ggm.make.graph, ggm.plot.graph

    o cor2pcor, pcor2cor, pcor
 
    o bagged.cov, bagged.cor, bagged.pcor  
   
    o cor0.test, cor0.estimate.kappa, cor.fit.mixture, cor.prob.nonzero
    
    o kappa2N, N2kappa
   
    o dcor0, pcor0, rcor0, ibeta functions
 
    o z.transform, hotelling.transform
    
    o robust.boot

    o fdr.estimate.eta0

    o pseudoinverse, rank.condition

    o standardize.cov, rebuild.cov
    
    o sm2vec, sm.indices, vec2sm 
 
    o is.positive.definite, is.symmetric, is.square
   
 
   
    
CHANGES

    o bacteria renamed to caulobacter to avoid collision with MASS package.
    
    o fdr.control renamed from fdr.test,  significant hypothesis are 
      now those with p <= cutoff rather than with p < cutoff,
      q-values are computed, and pi0 < 1 is now allowed.
 
   


		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 1.1


NEW FEATURES

    This version of GeneTS is a maintainance release only.

CHANGES


    o The functions periodogram.spec() and periodogram.freq() are now
      combined in the single function periodogram(). 

    o Rather than using angular frequencies between 0 and pi, GeneTS
      by default now uses frequencies between 0 and the Nyquist critical
      frequency fc = frequency()/2 (i.e. typically between 0 and 0.5). 

    o Given a constant time series fisher.g.test() now returns a p-value
      of 1 instead of issuing an error. The man page for fisher.g.test()
      is changed and slightly extended.

    o Previously, all methods in GeneTS assumed that the *rows* in a matrix
      contain the time series data.  This convention is now changed so that
      each *column* represents one time series (this follows the convention
      used by the ts package).  All functions and data sets in GeneTS are
      also changed accordingly.
    



		CHANGES IN GeneTS VERSION 1.0


NEW FEATURES

    First public release of GeneTS.  This version of GeneTS implements
    all methods for cell cycle analysis described in:

    Wichert, S., K. Fokianos, and K. Strimmer. 2004.  Identifying periodically
    expressed transcripts in microarray time series data. Bioinformatics 20:5-20.

NEW FUNCTIONS
      
      o the average periodogram for multiple time series (avgp)
      
      o Fisher's exact g test as gene selection method (fisher.g.test)
      
      o multiple testing using false discovery rate (fdr.test)
      
      o simplified interface to periodogram (periodogram)
      
      o some other utility function (is.constant, dominant.freqs)
      
      o parts of the bacterial data set by Laub et al. (2000) (caulobacter)
